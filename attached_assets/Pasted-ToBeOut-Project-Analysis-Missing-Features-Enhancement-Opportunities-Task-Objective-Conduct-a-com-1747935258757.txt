ToBeOut Project Analysis - Missing Features & Enhancement Opportunities
Task Objective
Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the ToBeOut Mini-MVP project to identify:

Missing critical components that are required for MVP functionality
Technical gaps that could impact system reliability
Enhancement opportunities to improve user experience and business value
Implementation priorities based on impact and effort

Analysis Framework
1. Current State Assessment
Review the existing project documentation, codebase, and implementation status to understand:

What has been implemented vs. what's documented
Quality and completeness of existing features
Technical architecture and scalability considerations
Integration points and dependencies

2. Gap Analysis Categories
A. Critical Missing Features (Must-Have for MVP)
Features that prevent the system from functioning as intended
B. Important Enhancements (Should-Have for Better UX)
Features that significantly improve user experience or business value
C. Nice-to-Have Additions (Future Considerations)
Features that add value but aren't essential for initial launch
D. Technical Improvements (Infrastructure & Reliability)
Backend improvements for stability, performance, and maintainability

 Deployment: Is the deployment process automated and reliable?
 Testing: What's the test coverage for critical functions?

Integration Architecture:

 Third-party APIs: How reliable are external integrations?
 Webhook Management: Are incoming webhooks properly secured?
 Data Synchronization: How is data consistency maintained?
 Offline Handling: What happens when services are unavailable?

5. User Experience & Business Logic Analysis
Guest Experience Flow:

 Booking Journey: How smooth is the end-to-end booking process?
 Multi-channel Consistency: Is experience consistent across channels?
 Error Recovery: Can users easily recover from mistakes?
 Accessibility: Is the system accessible to users with disabilities?
 Performance: Are response times acceptable for users?

Restaurant Operations:

 Daily Workflow: Does the system support typical restaurant operations?
 Staff Training: How easy is it for restaurant staff to learn the system?
 Busy Period Handling: Does the system work well during peak times?
 Conflict Resolution: How are booking conflicts handled?
