- **SUCCESS:** Implemented guest count to table capacity matching
- **SUCCESS:** Added preference-based table assignment
- **SUCCESS:** Created fallback logic for alternative options

### Booking Service Development
- **SUCCESS:** Created comprehensive booking service with 5 key functions:
  1. `findAvailableTables()` - Smart table availability checking
  2. `findAlternativeSlots()` - Alternative time/date suggestions
  3. `createReservation()` - Complete booking workflow
  4. `cancelReservation()` - Proper cancellation with status updates
  5. `getDateAvailability()` - Daily availability overview

### API Endpoints Implementation
- **SUCCESS:** Built 5 robust API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/booking/availability` - Check table availability
  - `GET /api/booking/alternatives` - Get alternative time slots
  - `POST /api/booking/create` - Create new reservation
  - `POST /api/booking/cancel/:id` - Cancel existing reservation
  - `GET /api/booking/date-availability` - Daily availability stats

## Phase 5: Reservation Management Interface (Day 4-5)
**Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

### Reservation Creation
- **SUCCESS:** Built comprehensive booking form with validation
- **SUCCESS:** Implemented real-time availability checking
- **SUCCESS:** Added guest lookup and auto-creation
- **SUCCESS:** Created confirmation and error handling

### Database Integration Issues & Solutions
- **CRITICAL BUG:** Reservation viewing failed with "or is not defined" error
  - **Issue:** Missing `or` import in Drizzle ORM queries
  - **Fix Date:** January 22, 2025 - 9:05 PM
  - **Solution:** Added `or` to import statement in storage.ts
  - **Result:** Reservation viewing restored, all CRUD operations working

### Reservation Status Management
- **SUCCESS:** Implemented reservation status workflow:
  - Created ‚Üí Confirmed ‚Üí Completed
  - Created ‚Üí Cancelled (with proper cleanup)
- **SUCCESS:** Added real-time status updates with immediate UI refresh
- **SUCCESS:** Built reservation history tracking

---

## Phase 6: Guest Database Implementation (Day 5)
**Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

### Guest List Interface
- **SUCCESS:** Beautiful guest database UI already existed
- **CRITICAL BUG:** Guest loading failed with "invalid input syntax for type integer"
  - **Issue 1:** Incorrect query parameter passing (`restaurantId` in URL)
  - **Fix Date:** January 22, 2025 - 9:10 PM
  - **Solution:** Removed unnecessary URL parameter from frontend query
  - **Result:** Partial fix, but database query still failing

- **CRITICAL BUG:** Database query syntax error in guest retrieval
  - **Issue 2:** Improper SQL `IN` clause construction with array values
  - **Fix Date:** January 22, 2025 - 9:14 PM
  - **Solution:** Replaced custom SQL with Drizzle ORM `inArray()` method
  - **Result:** Guest database fully functional

### Guest Analytics Enhancement
- **SUCCESS:** Added reservation count calculation for each guest
- **ENHANCEMENT:** Updated guest query to include total booking history
- **SUCCESS:** Real-time guest statistics (total guests, birthday info, email contacts)
