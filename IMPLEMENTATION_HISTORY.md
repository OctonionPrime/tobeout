## üéØ **LATEST CRITICAL FIXES** (January 23, 2025 - 12:22 AM)

### **Issue Resolution Session - Guest Data & Date Range**
**Status: ‚úÖ ALL CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED**

#### **Fix 1: Guest Names Display ‚úÖ RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: Guest names showed as "Guest" instead of real names like "Teg" and "Oleg"
- **Root Cause**: Field mapping mismatch between API (`guestName`) and frontend (`guest.name`)
- **Solution**: Updated reservations page to check both field formats
- **Files Modified**: `client/src/pages/reservations.tsx`
- **Result**: Real guest names now display correctly

#### **Fix 2: Phone Numbers Display ‚úÖ RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: Phone numbers showed as "No phone provided" instead of actual numbers
- **Root Cause**: Same field mapping issue affecting phone data
- **Solution**: Added fallback logic for `guestPhone` and `guest?.phone`
- **Result**: Actual phone numbers (+79881236777, 89012457888) now display

#### **Fix 3: Date Range Limitation ‚úÖ RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: Date selector only showed 4 days instead of full month
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded date options in Tables page component
- **Solution**: Replaced with dynamic 30-day generation using Array.from()
- **Files Modified**: `client/src/pages/tables.tsx`
- **Result**: Full month of dates (30 days) now available for selection
